# Ecommerce-Churn-Analysis
Churn problem refers to the issue of losing  customers who were previously active on  an online store.
Me and my colleagues worked on this project to try to solve a problem of churn for an E-commerce store, the data includes many aspects that we used to perform our analysis to get an idea about dempgrphics and customer behaviour, but first we had to deal with a lot of data cleaning and validation.
# Everthing about the project can be found in files:
    First: a notebook that was built on kaggle which includes data cleaning and validation, exploratory data analysis to try to get an idea about the data and identify if there is a pattern in the data or not, filling null values using different techniques as the data had a lot of missing values and finally we performed some preprocessing on our data to apply different machine learning models in order to predict if the customer is going to churn or not
    Second: a documentation that includes all steps that we have done through out the project and the reason behind every step we have done in the analysis
    
    Third: a power point that gives a brief about our analysis, why this analysis is so important for the business, how we dealt with the data, insights and the actions that company can take to reduce customer churn and some details about the process of data preprocessing and the applied machine learning models
    
    Fourth: a dashboard that visualizes the main insights in our analysis.
